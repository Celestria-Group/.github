# 👋 Welcome to Celestria Group
Our modern web development platform is built on a carefully selected stack of technologies that prioritize performance, developer experience, and scalability.

## Core Technologies we use
**⚡ Next.js** - Our React framework of choice that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and excellent developer experience out of the box. Next.js handles our routing, API routes, and optimizations automatically while maintaining the flexibility we need for complex applications.

**🚀 Express.js** - Powers our backend API services with a lightweight and flexible Node.js framework. Express handles our server-side logic, middleware, authentication, and database interactions with minimal overhead and maximum customization options.

**📘 TypeScript** - Adds static typing to our JavaScript codebase, catching errors at compile time and improving code maintainability. TypeScript enhances our development workflow with better IDE support, refactoring capabilities, and self-documenting code.

**🎨 Tailwind CSS** - Our utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with consistent design patterns. Tailwind eliminates custom CSS bloat while providing the flexibility to create unique designs through composable utility classes.

**⚡ Bun** - Our ultra-fast JavaScript runtime, package manager, and bundler that significantly accelerates our development workflow. Bun provides lightning-fast package installation, native TypeScript support, and built-in testing capabilities while maintaining Node.js compatibility for seamless integration with our existing stack.

**☁️ Cloudflare** - Handles our global content delivery, security, and edge computing needs. Cloudflare provides fast content delivery worldwide, DDoS protection, SSL certificates, and edge functions for optimal performance and security.
