# üëã Welcome to Celestria Digital

## Tech Stack Overview

Our modern web development platform is built on a carefully selected stack of technologies that prioritize performance, developer experience, and scalability.

### Core Technologies

**‚ö° Next.js** - Our React framework of choice that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and excellent developer experience out of the box. Next.js handles our routing, API routes, and optimizations automatically while maintaining the flexibility we need for complex applications.

**üöÄ Express.js** - Powers our backend API services with a lightweight and flexible Node.js framework. Express handles our server-side logic, middleware, authentication, and database interactions with minimal overhead and maximum customization options.

**üìò TypeScript** - Adds static typing to our JavaScript codebase, catching errors at compile time and improving code maintainability. TypeScript enhances our development workflow with better IDE support, refactoring capabilities, and self-documenting code.

**üé® Tailwind CSS** - Our utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with consistent design patterns. Tailwind eliminates custom CSS bloat while providing the flexibility to create unique designs through composable utility classes.

**‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudflare** - Handles our global content delivery, security, and edge computing needs. Cloudflare provides fast content delivery worldwide, DDoS protection, SSL certificates, and edge functions for optimal performance and security.

### Why This Stack

This combination delivers exceptional performance through Next.js optimizations and Cloudflare's global network, while TypeScript ensures code reliability and Tailwind accelerates development velocity. Express.js provides the backend flexibility we need, and the entire stack works seamlessly together for both development and production environments.
